"""Conceptual Exploration of Magmas in the Equational Theories Project (ETP).

This script demonstrates how Formal Concept Analysis and Attribute Exploration
can discover the implications between equational laws over magmas
(sets equipped with a single binary operation `*`).

Background:
The Equational Theories Project (ETP) investigates the web of implications
and non-implications between equational laws on magmas.
Using conceptual exploration:
1. The exploration engine proposes candidate implications P => C (premises imply conclusions).
2. The `MagmaExpert` evaluates the implication by checking if all magmas satisfying P also satisfy C.
3. If an implication is false, the expert provides a finite counterexample Magma (with Cayley table).
4. Duality symmetries (the anti-automorphism (x * y)^op = y^op * x^op) are leveraged
   to automatically map implications and reduce expert queries.
5. Queries where the solver runs out of its per-size budget are accepted but
   flagged [UNCONFIRMED], since they were neither refuted nor decided. With
   the Vampire expert, an implication is instead confirmed only when proved,
   counterexamples are searched for at any size, and an implication shown
   false without a counterexample on a particular law is rejected.
6. Optionally, implications derivable by equational reasoning within a bounded
   order are given to the exploration as background knowledge beforehand.
7. The log, the implications found and the context are saved to a results
   directory.
