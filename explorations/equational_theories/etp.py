"""Data of the Equational Theories Project (ETP) as input to an exploration.

The ETP decided every implication between two of its 4694 laws, numbered by
their line in its equations.txt. Three of its files are read here:

- equations.txt, the laws, one per line, with ◇ for the operation
  (https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/blob/main/data/equations.txt);
- graph.json, the implication graph its website shows: the 4694 x 4694
  outcomes, row the premise and column the conclusion, run-length encoded
  (https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/graph.json);
- files of finite magmas with one "Table [[...]]" per magma, such as those in
  equational_theories/Generated/All4x4Tables/data, or with an equation number
  before each table, as in data/smallest_magma_examples.txt.

The graph gives every implication with a single premise between laws of the
ETP, which an exploration can take as background implications and then only
ask about implications whose premise has several laws. Its magmas can seed the
expert's pool or the context. The implications it refutes can seed the context
as well, as partial objects known only on the laws the graph decides for them,
which covers refutations by infinite magmas.

Laws that imply each other are interchangeable in an implication, so an
exploration needs only one law of each class of equivalent laws:
`representatives` chooses them, closed under duality.
